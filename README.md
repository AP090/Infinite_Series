# Infinite_Series
This program uses the famous Gregory-Leibniz series to calculate the value of pi. This series follows the pattern: Ï€ = 4(1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7...). Unfortunately, this series converges very slowly on the actual value of pi; it takes 300 terms just to get it correct to two decimal places!
The program asks the user for how many terms they would like to calculate. The upper limit seems to be 2 billion terms, before Java oddly breaks for some reason. 
I plan to make more infinite series programs in the future, including one that uses a more efficent series to get pi. Then, I intend to use data on how the computer handles those calculations to calculate its processsing power. I have no idea how to do that, so it'll be off in the future.
